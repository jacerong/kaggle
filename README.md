This repository is intended to publish and, more importantly, share solution approaches to Kaggle challenges. Accordingly, the following is a list of these challenges I have been or am working on:

1. [San Francisco Crime Classification](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jacerong/kaggle/blob/master/sf-crime/solution-approach.ipynb). (Status: completed)

Note that each of the above items redirects to *nbviewer*, as it really improves the experience of viewing Jupyter notebooks.
